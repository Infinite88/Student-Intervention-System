One of it's strengths is that it can handle large data sets with high dimensionality. It also has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing. A flaw could be that it doesnt do to well dealing with regression problems. It doesn’t predict beyond the range in the training data, and that they may over-fit data sets that are particularly noisy.

First reason would be that as the data continued to increase, SVM performed the best with Random Forest coming in at a close second. Guassian Naive Bayes had a fast traininig and predicting time, but had a lower F1 score compared to the other algorithms. It took random forest much longer to train compared to SVM. SVM would give a high performance that could handle large datasets without having as high as a training time than Random Forest.**\n"

New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on. SVM also has a technique called the kernel trick. These are functions which takes a non separable problem and transforms it into a separable one. It is mostly useful in non-linear separation problem. Simply put, it does some extremely complex data transformations, then find out the process to separate the data based on the labels or outputs thats defined.**"
